# Lists in python

```
Lists are mutable collections of heterogenous/homogeneous data contained in []
```

# List declaration
```python
list_variable = list(); #Empty list
list_variable = [value1,value2,value3,...]; # generic declaration
```
Here, values can be of any primary data type in python.

# Access list elements
```
List elements are accessed using their indexes which run from 0-(sizeof list-1).
To get the sizeof list: len(list_variable)
```

# List traversal
```python
for iteration_variable in list_variable:
  ...perform tasks... # accesses element one by one
```
